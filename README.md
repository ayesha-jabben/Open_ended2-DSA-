Open-Ended Lab Task 2:
Objective:
Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest Palindrome that can be built with those letters. Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.

Submission Requirements:
Submit the program code along with comments explaining key sections of your implementation.
Optional: Submit screenshots of sample outputs or visualizations if implemented.

Examples:
Example 1:
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
Example 2:
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.
